## Where are the Scan Results?

Upon completion of the workflow, you can **find the scan results** in the dedicated 
**artifacts section** at the bottom of the workflow summary page. 
Look for a file named `scanpipe-outputs` in that section. 
This file contains the outputs generated by the `scancode-action`.
